# Systems Project2 - MyShell

## [insert creative team name here]

## Features 
- cd
- pipe
- redirect: basic redirection with just one > or < works

## Bugs
- pressing Ctrl-D or typing exit should end the program but sometimes it doesn't work ... no idea why, but it seems to be fine most of the time?
